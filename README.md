This is my self project about a Japanese Mahjong game called Tenhou.

In the code, you can paste your link (a tenhou ranking match paipu link). The code will fetch the paipu and output the result in the console.

The result such as :
* Agari rate, point
* Deal-in rate
* Pinfu rate
* Haipai Shanten
  and more

Note that this code is still being tested, so it might have some bugs. (If you found one, you can PR it)
